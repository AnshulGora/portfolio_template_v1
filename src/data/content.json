    "about_text": "Sup mate! I’m a Developer who enjoys solving complex problems, creating impactful and user-centered experiences across multiple platforms that are informed by research and data. \n\n I'm probably not the typical designer positioned behind an Illustrator artboard adjusting pixels, but I design. Immersed in stylesheets tweaking font sizes and contemplating layouts is where you'll find me. I'm committed to creating fluent user experiences while staying fashionable. \n\n When it comes to business, first impressions matter, and good website design is the key to capitalizing on them. An excellent site is not judged solely on its looks, but on its functionality and usability as well. My experience as a programmer allows me to come up with intelligent solutions to technical challenges, while at the same time designing sleek and visually appealing websites",
