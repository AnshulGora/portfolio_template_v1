## 🎨 Customization Guide

Follow these steps to personalize your website. All major content changes are handled through a single JSON file.

### 1. Meta Data & Favicon

Before editing the content, update the identity of your site in the browser:

- **Website Title**: Open `public/index.html` and update the `<title>` tag to your name.
- **Favicon**:
  1. Generate a custom icon at [favicon.io](https://favicon.io).
  2. Download and replace the existing files in the `public/` folder with your new icons.

### 2. The "Brain" (content.json)

All text and links are managed in `src/data/content.json`. Modify this file to reflect your information:

#### Profile

- **Name & Tagline**: Your professional identity and a catchy mission statement.
- **About Me**: A detailed paragraph describing your expertise and goals.
- **Contact & CV**: Your email, social links, and a link to your CV (hosted on Drive/Dropbox).

#### Projects

Add your work details here.

- **Description**: Keep project details to a 29-word maximum for the best layout.
- **Tech**: List technologies used (e.g., `#react #nodejs`).

#### Testimonials

- **Review**: Aim for 8 to 10 words per testimonial.
- **Company/Domain**: The affiliation of the person providing the review.

### 3. Assets (Images)

Images are stored in `src/assets/`. You can either:

- Replace the files in the folder using the exact same filenames (e.g., replace `anshul.jpg` with your own photo named `anshul.jpg`).
- Update the filenames in `content.json` to match your new uploaded files.
